       <p><strong>1. Review Scheduling:</strong> A one-week duration will be allocated for each review session. The Head of Department (HoD) nominee must coordinate with the panel members to agree on a mutually convenient time for conducting the reviews.</p>

<p><strong>2. Timely Review Completion:</strong> All reviews must be completed within the designated timeframe. Upon completion of the reviews, ensure that the attendance sheet is submitted to the Project Coordinator for record-keeping.</p>

<p><strong>3. Review Expectations:</strong> The review expectations, as previously shared, should be adhered to in order to properly assess the progress of student projects.</p>

<p><strong>4. Guide Endorsement Form Requirement:</strong> Only students who present the Guide Endorsement Form, duly signed by their guide, will be permitted to attend the reviews.</p>

<p><strong>5. Marks Documentation:</strong> All review reports, including marks, must be recorded directly in the Project Diary. The Project Coordinator will not provide separate forms or formats for review assessments.</p>

<p><strong>6. PRC Signatures:</strong> After each review, the members of the Project Review Committee (PRC) should sign their names at the bottom of the review report for each batch to validate the session.</p>

<p><strong>7. Communication with Project Coordinator:</strong> HoD nominees and PRC members are encouraged to contact the Project Coordinator for any clarifications or additional instructions related to the review process.</p>
