       <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">1. Minimum Attendance Requirement:</strong> Students must maintain a 
    minimum of <strong>80% attendance</strong>. It is essential to meet assigned guides regularly and arrive 
    at the department <strong>by 8:15 AM</strong> each day.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">2. Late Attendance Requests:</strong> Any student requesting attendance 
    from the Department Examination Officer (DEO) after <strong>8:25 AM</strong> will not be considered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">3. Attendance Recording Times:</strong> Attendance will be recorded 
    at three intervals during the day:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Before <strong>8:25 AM</strong> (start of the day).</li>
    <li><strong>Midday:</strong> Between <strong>10:25 AM - 1:00 PM</strong> (covering periods 3 to 5).</li>
    <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Between <strong>2:00 PM - 3:50 PM</strong> (covering late afternoon sessions).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">4. Post-Attendance Requests:</strong> Once attendance has been recorded, 
    no <strong>adjustments or modifications</strong> will be entertained by the DEO.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">5. Absence Due to Guide Meetings:</strong> If a student misses attendance 
    due to a meeting with their guide, they must present their <strong>Project Diary</strong> (duly signed by the guide 
    with the meeting time) to the DEO to obtain attendance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">6. Attendance for Teaching Assistants (TAs):</strong> TAs engaged in classes 
    during attendance recording periods must submit a <strong>signed TA slip</strong> from the respective faculty to the 
    DEO for attendance approval.

     <div>
        <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">1. Project Diary Acquisition:</strong> Every batch must acquire a 
    <strong> Project Diary</strong>, available at the Xerox shop. Students must carry it regularly to 
    record all necessary activities and information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">2. Daily Updates and Guide Signature:</strong> Students should bring their 
    Project Diary to their guide every day. All meetings, work progress, and relevant details must 
    be recorded with the date and time. The guide must <strong>sign</strong> after each meeting or review session.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">3. Important Content in the Project Diary:</strong> The diary must include:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Review reports:</strong> (0th to 3rd review reports).</li>
    <li><strong>Guide Endorsement Forms.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Summaries of review reports.</strong></li>
    <li>Any other documentation or feedback related to the project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">4. Guide Endorsement Form:</strong> Before attending each review, students 
    must obtain the guideâ€™s <strong>signature</strong> on the Guide Endorsement Form. This is mandatory for review attendance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">5. Review Attendance and Project Progress:</strong> Students will be assessed 
    during reviews, and marks will be awarded accordingly. These marks are documented in the Project Diary.

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">6. Submission of Review Reports:</strong> Each batch must submit a 
    <strong> Xerox copy</strong> of the review report to the Project Coordinator. Failure to submit will result in an 
    <strong>absence</strong> for that review, leading to a score of zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">7. Project Diary Safety:</strong> Since the diary contains crucial data (marks, 
    endorsements, review details), students must take proper care to avoid losing or misplacing it. It is 
    recommended to keep a <strong>backup copy</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">8. Timely Completion of Project Work:</strong> Students must complete all 
    project tasks, milestones, and reviews <strong>within the given deadlines</strong>. Delays may impact attendance 
    and review scores.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">9. Project Work Updates:</strong> Keep your project work updated regularly. 
    Ensure progress aligns with the project plan and guide expectations. If you face challenges, 
    seek guidance promptly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong className="text-gray-900">10. Documentation and Reports:</strong> All review reports, progress updates, 
    and feedback must be accurately documented in the Project Diary. These documents are essential 
    for evaluation and project performance assessment.

          <strong className="text-gray-900">4. Polite Communication with DEOs:</strong> Approach the DEO politely when requesting attendance,

          <strong className="text-gray-900">5. Absence from Reviews:</strong> If you are unable to attend a review, seek prior permission from your 
          guide and department. Ensure that all necessary documentation (such as the <strong>Guide Endorsement Form</strong>) is properly handled 
          to avoid missing marks.
